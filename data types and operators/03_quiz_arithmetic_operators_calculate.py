# In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler. 
# Two parts of a floor need tiling. One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long,
# the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long. Tiles come in packages of 6.

# Tiles bought
print("Owned tiles are", 17 * 6)

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles are needed.
print("Tiles needed are", (9*7) + (5*7))

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles will be left over.
print("Tiles will be left over are", (17 * 6) - ((9*7) + (5*7)))
